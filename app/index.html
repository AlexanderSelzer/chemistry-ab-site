            <p>
              The pH scale represents the <em>acidity</em> or <em>alkalinity</em> of a substance.
              It represents a range between both extremes, the values <em>0 </em> and <em>14</em>,
              categorizing a substance as either acidic, when lower than <em>7</em>, alkaline,
              when higher than <em>7</em>, or neutral, when around the middle value of <em>7</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Values on the pH scale are logarithmic (base 10). Every step value approaching the
              extremes is ten times more acidic than the previous.
              A pH-value of 4 is 100 times more acidic than a value of 6.

            <h3>Natural Factors</h3>
            <p>
              While strong changes in pH are often human-caused, the acidity or alkalinity of
              environments can vary in natural ways, too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pine forests and other trees usually increase the acidity of their environment.
              Decomposing needles release acids into the environment,
              and at fall, falling leaves will lower the pH of water.
              <br />
              Natural precipitation is slightly acidic, between the pH values of 5 and 6, due to
              Carbon Dioxide being dissolved.
              <br />
              Calcium Carbonate helps keep the pH close to 7 by combining with the Hydrogen atoms
              and neutralizing it.
              <br />
              In rarer events, volcanic erruptions may increase the acidity of water significantly.  
            </p>
            <h3>Human Factors</h3>
            <p>
              Human Actions have the potential to greatly disturb the pH balance, which is found in
              the nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mining openly can be seen as a great acceleration of erosion. This type of erosion
              releases minerals into the ground water at much higher rates than they would be in
              nature. The minerals are often highly soluble and strongly alkaline or acidic,
              affecting the pH.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acid Rain, caused mainly by the Burning of Coal and Petrol, can increase the acidity
              of ground water and lakes weakly to strongly, such as during the Indusrial Revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Direct polution through the dumping of polluting substances left over by the industry
              can very strongly affect the pH value, but in most cases this type of waste-management
              is illegal.

          <span class="title">The effects of pH on the ecosystem</span>
          <span class="text">
            <p>
              The pH value of ground water, water in seas, and water in rivers has a very strong effect
              the eosystem around it. By directly affecting the life inside the water, and the plants,
              all other animals will feel the impact of pH.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most organisms are comfortable around the most neutral pH values, near 7 at the scale, with
              tolerance for values slightly lower or higher.
              <br />
              Ground water is usually slightly alkaline, and sea life can tolerate this, however too strong
              values in both directions will damage life in the water.
              <br />
              Different animals will survive in different ranges of pH. As the value changes, species are
              not able to survive anymore, while others can, bringing the ecosystem out of its balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              A pH range of 6 to 9 will be safe for most sealife, however algae, which indirectly affects the
              whole food chain can only grow optimally in the range of 7.5 to 8.4
