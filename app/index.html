            <p>
              The pH scale represents the <em>acidity</em> or <em>alkalinity</em> of a substance.
              It is a measure of the potential of Hydrogen in a molecule,
              and represents a range between two limits, the values 0 and 14,
              categorizing a substance as either acidic, if lower than 7, alkaline,
              if higher than 7, or neutral, when at the middle value of 7.
            </p>
            <p>
              Values on the pH scale are logarithmic to the base of 10. Every value approaching the
              extremes is ten times more acidic than the previous.
              A pH-value of 4 is 100 times more acidic than a value of 6.

          <span class="text">
            <h3>Natural Factors</h3>
            <p>
              While strong changes in pH are often human-caused, the acidity or alkalinity of
              environments can vary in numerous natural ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Large forests of trees, especially pine trees, cause an increase in the acidity
              of their environment, as leaves or needles drop.
              Decomposing needles release acids into their environment,
              and falling leaves lower the pH of water when decomposing.
              <br />
              Natural precipitation is slightly acidic, measuring between the pH values of 5 and 6, due to
              Carbonic Acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) formed from from Carbon Dioxide being dissolved.
              <br />
              Calcium Carbonate in the ground assists in keeping the pH close to 7 by combining with the Hydrogen atoms
              and neutralizing it.
              <br />
              In the rarer events of volcanic erruptions, the acidity of water can be increased significantly.  
            </p>
            <h3>Human Factors</h3>
            <p>
              Human Actions have the potential to greatly disturb the pH balance, which persists in nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Open Mining</em> can be seen as a great acceleration of erosion. This type of erosion
              releases minerals into the ground water at much higher rates than they would be in
              nature. The minerals are often highly soluble and strongly alkaline or acidic,
              affecting the pH.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Acid Rain</em>, caused mainly by the release of Sulphur Dioxide (SO<sub>4</sub>)
              and Nitrogen Oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>),
              due to the burning of coal, can increase the acidity
              of ground water and lakes significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Direct Industrial Polution</em> through the dumping of polluting substances left over by the industry
              can very strongly affect the pH value, but in most cases this type of waste-management
              is illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Industrial Agriculture</em> utilizing fertilizers can release acidic substances into the water.

          <span class="title">The effects of pH on the ecosystem</span>
          <span class="text">
            <p>
              The pH value of the ground water and lake/river water has a very strong effect
              on the ecosystem surrounding it and being contained in it.
              <br />
              pH affects the solubility of substances in water, and with it the amount of nutrients that
              can be used by the organsims living in it. The toxicity of dangerous substances such as heavy metals
              is further increased, as the acidity increases, limiting their  chances of survival.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most organisms are only functioning effectively when suppied with water at a pH around
              the most neutral values, near pH 7, with a specific tolerance for values slightly lower or higher.
              <br />
              Ground water is usually slightly alkaline, and sea life can tolerate this, however too strong
              values in both directions will damage life in the water.
              <br />
              Different animals will survive in different ranges of pH. As the value changes, species are
              not able to survive anymore, while others can, bringing the ecosystem out of its balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              A pH range of 6 to 9 will be safe for most species living in the water, but algae, which directly affects the
              entire food chain, can only grow well within the range of pH 7.5 to pH 8.4.
              
              <br />
              Due to this, if the acidity or alkalinity of the water is too high, the ecosystem will be harmed.
              This will decrease the variety of species in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As low-pH water flows through the earth, it releases Aluminium from it,
              which flows into the seas, being poisonous to the fish.
