            <p>
              The pH scale represents the <em>acidity</em> or <em>alkalinity</em> of a substance.
              It represents a range between both extremes, the values <em>0 </em> and <em>14</em>,
              categorizing a substance as either acidic, when lower than <em>7</em>, alkaline,
              when higher than <em>7</em>, or neutral, when around the middle value of <em>7</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Values on the pH scale are logarithmic (base 10). Every step value approaching the
              extremes is ten times more acidic than the previous.
              A pH-value of 4 is 100 times more acidic than a value of 6.

          <span class="title">Factors influencing the pH value of water</span>
          <span class="text">
            <h3>Natural Factors</h3>
            <p>
              While strong changes in pH are often human-caused, the acidity or alkalinity of
              environments can vary in natural ways, too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pine forests and other trees usually increase the acidity of their environment.
              Decomposing needles release acids into the environment,
              and at fall, falling leaves will lower the pH of water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Natural precipitation is slightly acidic, between the pH values of 5 and 6, due to
              Carbon Dioxide being dissolved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Calcium Carbonate helps keep the pH close to 7 by combining with the Hydrogen atoms
              and neutralizing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In rarer events, volcanic erruptions may increase the acidity of water significantly.
            </p>
            <h3>Human Factors</h3>
            <p>
              Human Actions have the potential to greatly disturb the pH balance, which is found in
              the nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mining openly can be seen as a great acceleration of erosion. This type of erosion
              releases minerals into the ground water at much higher rates than they would be in
              nature. The minerals are often highly soluble and strongly alkaline or acidic,
              affecting the pH.
